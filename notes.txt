Set theory is a branch of mathematics based around the concept of sets. In simple terms, a set is a collection of things.

Notationally, mathematicians often represent sets with curly braces. Sets also follow two key rules:
Each element in a set is distinct.
The elements in a set are in no particular order. {1,2,3,4,5} == {5,3,2,4,1}
When defining a set, we often use a capital letter. A = {1,2,3,4,5}

Sets can also contain subsets. Set A is a subset of set B if all the elements in A exist within B.

A sample point is a single possible outcome of an experiment. Finally, a sample space is the set of all possible sample points for an experiment.

A specific outcome (or set of outcomes) is known as an event and is a subset of the sample space.
